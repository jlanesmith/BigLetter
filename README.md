# MiniProjects
This repository contains a couple mini projects that I've completed in my spare time:
1. BigLetter is a program that receives a String and then prints it out in a large font, made with specific characters.
2. Diamond is a very simple program that takes in an integer and then prints out a diamond of the given size.
